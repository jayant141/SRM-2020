This is digital age, where all the schools should be utilizing the digital tools. But for some reason they are not and the problem has to be faced by the teachers. There are a lot of problems which can be solved using softwares. So one such problem is result making problem. The teachers have to fill the marksheets and other data on multiple registers then they have upload the data on the governmentâ€™s site then the results is generated. So they have to fill the data multiple times. Where the time is wasted. There is another problem is that the government has to print the registers and sending them to the schools.a desktop application which will have students details and marks associates with them. Where teachers can add the students marks. The result will be calculated based on the marks entered.
